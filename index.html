                <h2>Brand Growth and Global Expansion</h2>
                <p>We launched our flagship brand DOMS in 2005, which revolutionised the Indian stationery and art materials industry. In 2012, we formed a strategic partnership with F.I.L.A. (Fabbrica Italiana Lapis ed Affini S.p.A.), Italy, a listed multinational company with a global presence. This partnership enabled international market access and strengthened our R&D and technological capabilities. We later acquired Pioneer Stationery Private Limited, expanding our paper stationery product portfolio.</p>
                <h2>Product Expansion and Backward Integration</h2>
                <p>In 2023, we acquired a minority stake in ClapJoy Innovations Private Limited, entering the toys segment to broaden our offerings for kids, children, and young adults. In the same year, we acquired a majority stake in Micro Wood Private Limited, a manufacturer of tin and paper-based packaging materials. This acquisition supports our strategy of backward integration and improved manufacturing efficiency.</p>
